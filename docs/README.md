# Welcome to ViMMS

Welcome to **V**irtual **M**etabolomics **M**ass **S**pectrometer 
(**VIMMS**), a programmable and modular framework that simulates fragmentation strategies in tandem mass spectrometry-based 
metabolomics. 

You can use ViMMS to simulate various fragmentation strategies in a tandem mass spectrometry process. Virtual chemicals can
be generated by sampling either from HMDB, in a purely synthetic manner or extracted from existing mzML files
(through peak picking). These chemicals are then run through a simulated LC-MS process, and different
fragmentation strategies, implemented in the form of controllers, could be applied whether in a single- or multi-sample setting. 
The performance of different controllers can be evaluated using methods that we provide. 

ViMMS provides a unified framework to develop, test and optimise fragmentation strategies in LC-MS metabolomics.
An extension is also available to let ViMMS controllers to run directly on [Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/IQLAAEGAAPFADBMBCX)
instrument. You'd need to have a license of [IAPI](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/iapi) to do so -- please contact us if 
this is of any interest.

# Installation

**Stable version**


ViMMS requires Python 3+. You can install the current release of ViMMS using pip or pipenv. 

```$ pip install vimms```
or
```$ pipenv install vimms```

The current version can be found in the [Release page](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms/releases).
or from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/vimms/#history).

**Older version**
- You can download ViMMS 1.0 used in our [original paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/9/10/219) from here: <a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/196360601"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/196360601.svg" alt="DOI"></a>
It contains codes up to the first paper, but they are quite out-of-date now. 

**Development version**

To use the latest bleeding-edge ViMMS code in this repository, follow the steps below to check out the master branch. Note that this repository is in active development, so some things may break (please report an issue in that case).

1. Clone this repository by checking out the master branch: `git clone https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms.git`.
2. We provide two ways to manage the dependencies required by ViMMS. The first is using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), and the second is to use [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com). Refer to Section A and B below respectively.

***A. Managing Dependencies using Pipenv***

1. Install pipenv (https://pipenv.readthedocs.io).
2. In the cloned Github repo, run `$ pipenv install` to create a new virtual environment and install all the packages need to run ViMMS.
3. Go into the newly created virtual environment in step (4) by typing `$ pipenv shell`.
4. In this environment, you could develop new controllers, run notebooks (`$ jupyter lab`) etc. 

***B. Managing Dependencies using Pipenv***

1. Install Anaconda Python (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. In the cloned Github repo, run `$ conda env create --file environment.yml` to create a new virtual environment and install all the packages need to run ViMMS.
3. Go into the newly created virtual environment in step (4) by typing `$ conda activate vimms`.
4. In this environment, you could develop new controllers, run notebooks (`$ jupyter lab`) etc.
