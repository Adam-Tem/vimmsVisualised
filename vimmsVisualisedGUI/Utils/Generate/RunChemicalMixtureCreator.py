    ##Set the geometry every time a different combo box option is made.
    ## Shouldn't be too hard to implement, but at the same time,
    ## how do you delete only the specific parameters associated with
    ## the combo box change that has occured?????
    ## Can't really be making a wrapper of every q widget type??
    ## Have a dictionary that stores all the present parameters,
    ## that gets updated every time a change is made.
    ## Just need to keep track of..... nothing really, I guess
    ## we just need to evaluate the position in the grid of the combo
    ## box that is being changed, then adding the associated params
    ## while adjusting the necessary ones that are beneath it,
    ## using a for loop that iterates over objects that are beneath:
    ## for widget in grid that are below val (below, n):
    ##     move to new position.
    ## Assign this functionality tooooo the combo boxes, but in an
    ## abstracted way that takes in the row and column of them?
    ## but has to involve the addition of rows that are used for 
    ## params above it, maybe in an array??? Again, another sort
    ## of global private variable. :(
