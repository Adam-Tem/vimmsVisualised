This folder contains example notebooks that demonstrate how ViMMS can be used in different scenarios:

- **01. Download Data.ipynb** downloads and pre-process the example data used in other notebooks. Please run this first.
- **02. MS1 Simulations.ipynb** performs full-scan MS1 simulation on a single sample. This corresponds to Section 3.1 of the paper.
- **03. Top-N Simulations.ipynb** performs Top-N Data-Dependant Acquisition protocol on a single sample derived from an existing experimental file and compares the results. This corresponds to Section 3.2 of the paper.
